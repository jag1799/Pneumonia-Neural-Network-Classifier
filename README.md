# Pneumonia-Neural-Network-Classifier
This project consists of a Neural Network that takes in X-ray images of lungs and classifies whether they have a type of pneumonia or not. 
3 models will be tested against each other to determine the best performing version, model 1 serving as a benchmark.

A secondary objective to this project is to investigate how using different built-in features can affect this data set
in particular.

All files were originally created and tested within google colab.
